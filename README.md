# Saccade_EyeTracking_Signal_analysis

1. To Read The Data
2. load the l_x and l_y signal data in a variable
3. Then cut the signal from 21 and 32 seconds.
4. design and use different filters (i.e. firwin, medfilt, savgol) to remove low/high freqency noises
6. To plot the filtered and the raw data on the same graph (To compare)
7. Plot the original data with different filtered dayta to compare filters
8. 2D plot of the data that represents the duration of each saccade as a function of their amplitude
